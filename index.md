Just facetimed with my mom and dad, they seem well. Excited about Christmas

Mom is buying me a cake from a bakery in Kitsilano, Breka. She recommended caramel-praline

Also spoke with my grandparents earlier, they seem well. They went to DQ for milkshakes earlier, granny had an upset stomach.
I've been espousing the health benefits of ice cream for years, 
glad they finally came around!

Andrew has a surgery to extract his tooth tomorrow, which doesn't sound pleasant. 
I'm gonna give him a call soon.
